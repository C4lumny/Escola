**NOTE (optional)**:
  - The API implemented in this project can be used both on localhost and deployed. It is the decision of the person who is using the project. To use this project with the API deployed we do not edit anything, we leave the lib/api.ts file as it is:

  - If we want to use the api on localhost we have to clone it from another repository, edit the baseURL to that of localhost (in the page code) and comment on the Render one, then execute the API first before the page executes it:
